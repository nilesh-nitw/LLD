Creating a complete Low-Level Design (LLD) of a Parking Lot system in Java involves:

Requirements gathering

Entity identification

Class design with OOP principles

Design Patterns

Extensibility hooks

Enums, interfaces, services

Exception handling

Support for complexity like multiple floors, vehicle types, pricing, etc.

ðŸ§¾ Requirements
Functional
Park and unpark vehicles

Multiple vehicle types: Car, Bike, Truck

Parking floors and slots

Pricing per hour based on vehicle type

Display available slots

Ticket generation

Admin operations: Add floors/slots

Non-functional
Extensible design

Thread-safe (in future)

Maintainable and testable code

ðŸ§± High-Level Components
ParkingLot: Central class

Floor, Slot, Vehicle, Ticket, Payment

ParkingStrategy: Interface for assigning slot

ParkingService: Core parking/unparking logic

DisplayService: Show available slots

PricingStrategy: Interface to calculate fees


ðŸ“Œ Extensibility Options
Add ElectricVehicle with charging slots

Add real-time monitoring using Observers

Add different pricing strategies via Factory Pattern

Add user authentication/admin roles

Make thread-safe with locks or concurrency utils
